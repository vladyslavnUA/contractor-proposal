I am going to create something in the real estate field. Most likely a site where two different types of people can have accounts: User profile and Realtor profile. 
A user is able to save listings, CRUD their user profiles and contact realtors of the properties they're interested in. 
A realtor is able to CRUD their listing and message clients.
Possible Key Features: User to Realtor messaging, Customizable UI/UX (user can change site's color scheme), and user bidding on properties.
